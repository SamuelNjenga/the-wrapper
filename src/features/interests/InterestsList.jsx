        Apart from being a web developer, I spend a part of my time being
        outdoors just engaging in creative activities. At times when indoors, I
        spend my time exploring the latest technology advancements in both the
        front-end and back-end development world. I also participate in solving
        puzzles which gets interesting most of the times.
