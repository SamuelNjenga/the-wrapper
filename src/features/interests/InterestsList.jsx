        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being
        outdoors. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in video games. During the
        warmer sesons, I enjoy biking to some degree. When forced indoors, I am
        an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring
        the latest technology advancements in both the front-end and back-end
        web development world.
