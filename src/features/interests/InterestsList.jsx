        Apart from being a software engineer, I spend part of my time outdoors
        just engaging in a number of creative activities. At times when indoors,
        I spend my time exploring the latest technology advancements in both the
        front-end and back-end development world. I also participate in solving
        puzzles which really does get interesting most of the times.
