      <h5>Software Engineer (January 2016 - Present) </h5>
      Hired as one of the first employees to a very successful software
      development consultancy. Created web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps
      to create pixel perfect designs to match prototypes created by the design
      team. Quickly picked up projects with unfamiliar technologies by
      self-learning new languages, frameworks, and APIs to implement new
      features based on clients’ needs. Created estimates, planned SCRUM
      Sprints, communicated directly with clients, and review other developers’
      pull requests.
